This archive provides analysis scripts and datasets for
the standalone analyses of 3 climatic series, marine sedimenation
area, global temperatire and sealevel. It also contains connection
analysis scripts for these 3 series plus fragmentation rate versus
the 3 marine life diversification rate series we have (origination,
extinction and sampling).

Each connection analysis is divided into 3 parts, in order to
overcome numerical instability issues:

<climatic>_vs_diversity.R - This is a script that performs connection
analysis between one climatic series and the 3 diversification series.
<climatic> stands in for either fragementation rate ("fragrate"), marine
sedimentaiton area ("marinearea"), sealevel ("sealevel") or global
temperature ("globaltemperature"). At the stat, a run number is defined
("run.nr=1"). This can easily be replaced by a different run number so
that the result file is stored with a different name.

<climatic>_vs_diversity_collect.R - When <climatic>_vs_diversity.R
has been run a sufficient number of times with different run numbers,
this script collects the results and extracts the run with the highest
maximum likelihood for each model. This is then stored in a file
called "<climatic>_vs_diversity_collected.Rdata".

<climatic>_vs_diversity_collected.R - Fetches the  best estimated model
for each connection model from the file
"<climatic>_vs_diversity_collected.Rdata", see
<climatic>_vs_diversity_collect.R. Then performs chi-squared likelihood
ratio test on each of these conneciton models. This is then compared
to a Bonferroni-corrected limit, 0.05/54 (where 54 is the number of
p-values calculated).


The input datasets are mostly stored in Rdata files, though fragementation
rate is in a csv file.
